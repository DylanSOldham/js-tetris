                I've been gradually developing a graphics framework to help me more easily
                create games and simulations on the HTML canvas. I've been adding functionality 
                to it incrementally by creating small projects with it. This is one of the first of 
                those projects.
            </p>
            <p>
                The web browser provides a level of convenience for sharing small projects that I
                don't think any other platform could provide. Almost any application is immediately
                supported by a wide variety of operating systems - although mobile ones may require
                special attention to avoid the requirement of a keyboard.
                I also like being able to show my work to my friends just by sending a direct link, 
                rather than by coordinating a download. It also makes showing my work on a portfolio
                pretty simple.
