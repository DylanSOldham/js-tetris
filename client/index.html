                I had been gradually developing a graphics framework to help me more easily
                create games and simulations on the HTML canvas. This was one of the first of 
                those projects.

                The web browser provides a level of convenience for sharing small projects that I
                don't think any other platform could provide. Almost any web application is immediately
                available on all major platforms - although mobile platforms may require special attention.
                I also like being able to show my work to my friends just by sending a direct link, 
                rather than by coordinating a download. This also makes showing my work on a portfolio
                pretty simple.
